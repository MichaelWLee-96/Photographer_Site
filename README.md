 Professional photographer mock website

User Stories:
1. As Ann, a recently engaged woman, I want to talk to the photographer, so I can better understand how my wedding photos will progress.
2. As Steve, a baseball coach, I want to view the photographer's completed works, so I can find an entertaining and professional experience for my team's end of season photoshoot.
3. As Mary, a restaurant owner, I want to analyze photographer's experience, so I can trust that my food and restaurant environment is properly conveyed through my catalog.

My name is Michael Lee.
